h2.heading-margin-top(id="Overview") Overview
p MultiMC is a free, open source launcher for Minecraft. It allows you to have multiple, separate instances of Minecraft (each with their own mods, texture packs, saves, etc) and helps you manage them and their associated options with a simple interface.

The version on this website, MultiMC5, is in active development and can manage all versions of Minecraft that the new vanilla launcher can (including 1.6.x and above) - but it might have bugs in it.
