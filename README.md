# MultiMC website

Uses Grunt to compile UIkit/the website assets. The content generator itself is still undecided.

Run Grunt in the uikit folder and then in the main folder to compile what currently exists (or use "grunt watch" to automatically compile on changes). Output suitable for public use is compiled in to the dist folder.

UIkit tests are available for the theme in uikit/tests.
